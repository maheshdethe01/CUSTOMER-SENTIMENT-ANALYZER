    "#### Problem Statement \n",
    "1. We have IMDB movies reviews dataset where there are two columns named reviews and sentiment with 50000 rows.\n",
    "2. We have to build a model (to predict the sentiment) on the basis of data & data which will be predicted afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "1. Clean the Data\n",
    "2. Pre-Process the Data (Stemming or Lemmatizer and Count Vectorization,etc.)\n",
    "3. Build the model (DecisonTree, RandomForest,XGBoostClassifier,LightBGMClassifier)\n",
    "4. Evaluate the result using metrics (accuracy,precision,recall)\n",
    "5. Select the model with best metrics"
